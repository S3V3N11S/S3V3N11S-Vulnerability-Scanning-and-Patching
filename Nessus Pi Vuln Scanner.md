# Tenable Nessus Raspberry Pi 4 Project

**Note**: This is not my first time using Nessus, and this is an old project of mine that I am now doing the write-up for, so some details may be excluded.

## Goal
Identify vulnerabilities and vulnerable devices, patch them, and remove attack vectors.

## Summary
In this project, I installed Nessus on my Raspberry Pi 4 and configured it to routinely scan my network for any vulnerable devices, especially IoT devices.

### Steps

1. **Image Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit**
    - Downloaded and installed Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit onto an SD card.

2. **Configure SSH for Remote Access**
    - Enabled SSH to access the Pi from my workstation for easier management.

3. **Update and Upgrade the Pi**
    - Ran `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade` to ensure the OS and packages were up-to-date.

4. **Install and Configure Nessus on the Pi**
    - Downloaded Nessus package for Debian-based systems.
    - Installed the package using `dpkg -i <package_name>.deb`.

5. **Start Nessus Service**
    - Started the Nessus service using `sudo systemctl start nessusd.service`.

6. **Verify Service Status**
    - Verified the Nessus service was running with `sudo systemctl status nessusd.service`.

7. **Access Nessus Web Interface**
    - Accessed the Nessus web interface from my workstation at `https://<Pi_IP_Address>:8834`.

8. **Activate Nessus**
    - Logged in and activated Nessus using a provided activation key.

9. **Access Nessus Dashboard**
    - Once activated, I accessed the Nessus dashboard to configure scans.

10. **Configure a New Scan for the Network**
    - Configured a new scan by specifying an IP range of the network.
    - Enabled options such as scanning network printers.

11. **Run Non-Credentialed Scan**
    - Set up a non-credentialed scan for initial network assessment.
    - Ran the scan and evaluated the results.

### Detailed Steps and Observations

- **Install Nessus on Raspberry Pi**
    - The installation process was straightforward using the Debian package.
    - Nessus was configured as a headless server, making it accessible remotely via the web interface.

- **Scan Configuration**
    - Utilized various pre-configured scan templates provided by Nessus, including:
        - Mobile Device
        - Web Application
        - Malware
        - IoT Device scans
    - Each template provided targeted vulnerability assessments tailored to specific device types and services.

### Results

- **Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**
    - Identified a buffer overflow vulnerability in a virtual machine.
    - Remediated the issue with a software update.

- **Open Port 22 on Router**
    - Discovered that Port 22 was open on the residential router.
    - Contacted the ISP, who informed that it was for management purposes.
    - The port was filtered by the ISP, raising concerns about the lack of user control over the router's security settings.

### Conclusion
As of now, my Nessus scanner is offline due to new projects, but I will definitely return to it as it is an excellent tool for monitoring attack vectors and patching vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. This write-up does not do Nessus justice; it offers numerous pre-configured scans and the capability to perform credentialed scans, providing a comprehensive security assessment.
